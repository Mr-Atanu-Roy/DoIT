## ❤️ Philosophy


> **Productivity should reduce anxiety, not create it.**

### ✨ What Problem Does It Solve?

- **No more hidden backlogs:** Tasks not completed don't vanish—they move to Overdue so you can't ignore them, but they don't clutter your "Today".
- **Clarity over guilt:** You always know what matters *today*.
- **Frictionless rescheduling:** Move unfinished tasks to tomorrow in bulk.
- **Calm consistency:** Built for people who want to work calmly and consistently, not hustle endlessly.

---

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🗓 Today-First Task Management

- See only what’s relevant for **today**.

### 🔄 Smart Rescheduling

- **Bulk reschedule** unfinished tasks at the end of the day.
- Track how often a task is postponed (without shaming, just for awareness).

### ⚠️ Gentle Overdue Handling

- Missed tasks are clearly visible in an **Overdue view**.
- They don't disappear, but they don't clutter your minimal "Today" list.
- Encourages recovery and planning, not guilt.

### 📊 Daily Progress & Focus
